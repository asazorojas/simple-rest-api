Please use Golang 1.16.4 from the beginning because there seems to be a problem with Go1.17 and gin gonic.

If you already have a golang 1.17.x please do as follows:

go get golang.org/dl/go1.16.4
go1.16.4 download

Execute the api running:

Newest folder structure:
go1.16.4 run main.go

Old folder structure:
Go1.16.4 run api/api.go

To remove the vendor folder from the project just delete the vendor folder with rm -rf vendor and then run:

go1.16.4 mod tidy

Extra dependencies if needed are added with go get url of the dependencies and then re run go1.16.5 mod tidy again.

To re-create the vendor folder in your project just run go1.16.4 mod vendor



To run tests, when available just run:
go1.16.4 test ./...
